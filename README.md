This is a single page application project
Welcome to Sogy, a landing page for an imaginary hotel! Sogy represents my first project in React, marking a significant milestone in my journey as a web developer. After transitioning from vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I immersed myself in React to enhance my skills and explore the vast possibilities it offers. Sogy not only showcases my technical abilities but also highlights my growing expertise in designing appealing user interfaces. With this project, I focused on creating an aesthetically pleasing website that captures the essence of a luxurious hotel experience. By leveraging the power of React, I was able to build a dynamic and interactive landing page that engages visitors and provides a seamless browsing experience.  Throughout the development process, I invested time and effort in understanding the principles of UI design, ensuring that Sogy embodies modern design trends and best practices. The use of elegant typography, thoughtful color schemes, and carefully selected visuals contributes to an immersive and visually striking interface.
